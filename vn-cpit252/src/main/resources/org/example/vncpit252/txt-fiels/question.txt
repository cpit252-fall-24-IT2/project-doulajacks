The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance.|The Singleton pattern uses a public constructor.|The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern.|The Singleton pattern provides a global point of access to the instance.|The Singleton pattern is used to share instances across multiple classes.|
The Prototype pattern allows object creation by copying existing instances.|The Prototype pattern avoids the cost of creating new objects from scratch.|The Prototype pattern requires objects to implement a clone method.|The Prototype pattern is a structural design pattern.|The Prototype pattern supports deep cloning of objects.|
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.|The Adapter pattern is used to convert one interface into another.|The Adapter pattern is typically implemented as a wrapper class.|The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern.|The Adapter pattern is used to modify existing class behavior.|
The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step.|The Builder pattern helps create immutable objects.|The Builder pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation.|The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern.|The Builder pattern allows for the creation of different representations of an object.|
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.|The Proxy pattern controls access to the real object.|The Proxy pattern is a behavioral design pattern.|The Proxy pattern is used to defer the cost of object creation.|The Proxy pattern can implement logging and access control mechanisms.|
The Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by sharing objects.|The Flyweight pattern is used for managing a large number of similar objects.|The Flyweight pattern is a behavioral design pattern.|The Flyweight pattern uses intrinsic and extrinsic state.|The Flyweight pattern is used for optimizing system performance.|
The Decorator pattern allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object at runtime.|In the Decorator pattern, decorators directly modify the functionality of the original object.|The Decorator pattern is used to modify an objectâ€™s internal data and state.|In the Decorator pattern, the base component and the decorators must implement the same interface.|The Decorator pattern requires a direct inheritance relationship between the decorator and the component.|
The Observer pattern is used when a change in one object needs to be automatically reflected in other objects.|In the Observer pattern, the observer objects must constantly check for updates from the subject.|The Observer pattern involves direct communication between the observer and the subject.|The Observer pattern can be used in UI frameworks to update views automatically when data changes.|In the Observer pattern, the subject maintains references to its observers and notifies them of any state changes.|
